Each FreeCodeCamp certification requires to complete 5 projects to finalise the course. I have built 15 projects, including static webpages, a random quote generator, a pomodoro clock, a calculator, a markdown text editor and a drum-machine. I have centralised my last 5 projects in a GitHub repository where you'll find links to the hosted projects.
