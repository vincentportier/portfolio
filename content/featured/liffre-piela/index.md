Liffré-Piéla is a French charity that helps the underpriviliged region of Piela in Africa. They couldn't afford a domain, hosting and CMS monthly fees and wanted a solution that didn't require coding knowledge. I decided to use Gatsby on the front-end paired with netlify hosting and netlify CMS on the backend for a completely free stack. With netlify CMS, they have a wysiwyg solution to add their content that I am able to query with graphql in Gatsby to generate pages, routes and articles. Netlify CMS pushes new content as markdown directly to the github repo and triggers a build of the website which allows them to create new content without having to go into the code. The website has a perfect score in Lightouse in the speed, accessiblity, best practices and SEO categories.
