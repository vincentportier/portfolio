First iteration of my personal portfolio. I have built it with Gatsby and React and it is hosted with Netlify. Gatsby ships with some great features like a built-in Router or image optimisation tools which convinced me to use it for my website. I used Hooks and Context to manage dark mode and scrollReveal for some of the animations. I am using graphql and markdown files to make it super easy to update the website or add new content.
